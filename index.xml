      <description>Motivation As per the survey conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 60% people in United states haven’t received influenza (flu) vaccination. People don’t go for vaccination until they hear many victims for flu. This is true for other contagious diseases as well.
In many areas people are not aware of which contagious diseases people are suffering from in their neighborhood.
H1N1 influenza, first detected in Mexico in April 2009 and the virus was originally referred as “swine flu” because many of the genes in the new strain were found in pigs in USA.</description>

      <description>The Challenge Meeting with Chappy Callanta of 360 Pro led us to discover the root problem — the implementation of their performance testing framework.

The document calculates a total pro score based on an athlete&amp;rsquo;s performance for specific exercises, but the coach using it has to refer to several norms before assigning a pro score.</description>

      <description>Context The Ateneo Junior Marketing Association always outsourced their website development to different organizations in the university. This year, they chose User Experience Society, the organization I founded to create a strong digital presence for their flagship event. TEDxADMU is acclaimed among the youth and is marked by the many up and coming trailblazers in the Philippine community.
The Challenge TEDxADMU always faced the same problems every year. How can we elevate the number of applications we receive?</description>
